          <p className="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-900 transition-colors">
            HIPAA Privacy refers to regulations and guidelines governing the use
            and disclosure of protected health information (PHI), outlining
            individuals’ rights about their PHI as well as covered entities and
            business associates’ responsibilities in protecting it. HIPAA
            Compliance refers to the process of meeting these guidelines.

          <p className="mt-4 text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-900 transition-colors">
            HIPAA, first established as federal law in 1996, sets national
            standards to protect individuals’ medical records and personal
            health information. Its main goal is to ensure patient privacy,
            security and confidentiality. It applies to healthcare providers,
            plans and clearinghouses known as covered entities as well as
            business associates who handle PHI on behalf of such covered
            entities. So these organizations must abide by HIPAA regulations to
            stay compliant.
